    "Python 3 is a highly expressive programming language. \n",
    "You can use Python to write state-of-the-art machine learning code, run a large network of web servers, or use it as a calculator. \n",
    "One of the aims of the inventors of Python was to write a programming language with an intuitive **syntax**---a set of words, operators, and structure considered correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers don't speak the language as humans.\n",
    "They speak in machine code, long sequences of Binary code (think of the movie The Matrix).\n",
    "How programming languages translate between human input, what we type into our computer, and machine code, what the computer understands, is called the **Programming Process**.\n",
    "The majority of languages approach this process by either being **interpreted** or **compiled**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interpreted** language translates human code into machine code line by line, sometimes called \"on the fly\". \n",
    "A major advantage to interpreted languages, vs compiled, is how much easier it is to run these programs.\n",
    "The user does need to complete any additional steps beyond writing their code.\n",
    "On the downside, interpreted languages tend to be a bit slower than their compiled counterparts.\n",
    "Python 3 is an interpreted language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming languages require you to predefine resources for all the variables you plan to create. \n",
    "This is called **static typing**. \n",
    "Python 3 is not one of these languages. \n",
    "Instead, Python 3 figures out the resources you'll need from your code---called **Dynamic typing**---and makes it much faster to write code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of an interpreted, Dynamically typed language is to trade the time it takes to run a program (longer with Python 3) with the time it takes to write the program itself (slower with a compiled, statically typed language). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to learn how to  \n",
